# Signal Faker

This project generates fake data and displays them in a graph. It is divided in two smaller projects, one for data faking and another for  frontend rendering. It uses [Koa.js](https://koajs.com/) in a pure backend server and [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) as a frontend server with server-side rendering.
